This website showcases my personal and academic projects. Feel free to explore my work and download my resume.
The idea is to have a fun ongoing project where I can try things out and stay comfortable with Git and HTML, while also helping in the job hunt. Nothing fancy, just HTML and hosted on GitHub.
